 @header JMXThreadedEntity.h
 @abstract Base (abstract) class representing a threaded entity in the JMX world
 @discussion Threaded entities are those which require an active runloop to let them produce
             a signal at a given frequency. Not all entities need to be threaded, consider
             subclassing JMXEntity instead of this class if you don't really need an active thread
             to drive production of output signals
